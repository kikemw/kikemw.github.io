I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University. In the summer of 2025, I will join the AGI Lab at Westlake University as a visiting student. I have been honored with the first-class scholarship from my university and have also served as the class monitor. I am advised by Prof. Liqi Yan (Associate Professor) and Prof. Chi Zhang (Assistant Professor).

Hobbies
======
I have a keen interest in sports, particularly hiking and running, which I find invigorating and refreshing. I also enjoy singing as a way to express myself creatively. In addition, I have a fondness for listening to gentle music, as it helps me unwind and relax. However, my favorite activity is traveling. Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures brings me immense joy and broadens my horizons.
